* Graph Neural Networks for Capturing Dependencies in Graph Structured Data
** Understanding graph convolutions
Key component for building GNNs

Motivation: 

Shift-invariance
Locality
Hierarchy

Number of trainable parameters does not depend on the dimensionality of the input

Graphs also have natural priors that justify a convolutional approach

In images, the prior is on locality in 2D space, while with graphs, it is structural locality

Intuitively, this means that a node that is one edge away is more likely to be related than a node five edges away 

Any graph convolution needs to be permutation invariant
Most graph datasets contain graphs of varying sizes

Each row of X as being an embedding of the information that is stored at the node corresponding to that row

Graph convolutions update the embeddings at each node based on the embeddings of their neighbors and themselve
