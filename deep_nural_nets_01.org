1. TensorFlow, it's main feature and other DNN libraries
   - Open source library for numerical computations
   - Core is similar to that of numpy
   - GPU support
   - Distributed computing support
   - Computation Graph analysis
   - 
     
2. TensorFlow and Numpy
   tf offers most functionality of numpy
   tf.reduce_sum vs np.sum()
   Different behavior of some of the functions
   numpy tranpos shows tranposed view
   tf tranpos coverts into tranpose array
   numpy arrays are mutable
